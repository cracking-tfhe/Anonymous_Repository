This repository provides the code that has been used to demonstrate a reaction-based attack on two popular LWE-based FHE libraries, namely FHEW and TFHE. 

In case of FHEW, the attack has been carried out without and with timing information.

In case of TFHE, the attack has been carried out without and with timing information. The attack with timing information works with bootstrapping enabled and disabled.

Please follow the instructions provided in each folder in order to simulate the attack on local device.
