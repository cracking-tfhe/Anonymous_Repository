This repository provides the code that has been used to demonstrate an error and full key recovery attack on a popular LWE-based FHE library, namely TFHE. We assume that the server is provided with the ability to decrypt the result of a homomorphic NAND gate evaluation. However, the code also works for other homomorphic gates as well by appropriately changing the values of pos_threshold and neg_threshold, that corresponds to the positive and negative thresholds for the targeted gate. The reason we chose to demonstrate our attack for a NAND gate is that it is a universal gate and any circuit can be built using NAND gate only.

The instructions to simulate the attack on local device are provided in the readme file inside the TFHE folder.
